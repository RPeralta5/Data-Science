Regression Techniques
Predict a continuous valued output for each observation.
– Labels are continuous (numeric), e.g., stock price, housing price
– Can define ‘closeness’ when comparing prediction with true values

Normalize -> and then do dimensionality reduction -> cross validation -> regression techniques
Use graphs to show each line

At the end, use graphs to visualize all of the lines!



NOTES
11/26/2019. - need to use Label Encoder on data, cannot have strings in the dataset!
