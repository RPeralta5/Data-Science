Final Review

Lecture 1
  DataScience - is an interdisciplinary field of research that aims to design and develop automated and semi-automated techniques to extract knowledge(info) from large-scale data and use it for future purposes such as prediction, decision making, or recommendation.

Lecture 2
  Data, Machine learning, big data manipulation and processing

  Machine Learning - Designing and constructing algorithms or methods that give computers the ability to learn from past data, without being explicitly programmed, and then make predictions on future data.

  Observation, features, labels, training data, testing data

  Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, semi-supervised learning

Lecture 3
  Classification vs Regression

  KNN

  Scale Features -> Value_Scaled = Value / Max(Value) -> After normalization, 0 <= Value_Scaled <= 1
