Final Review

Lecture 1
  DataScience - is an interdisciplinary field of research that aims to design and develop automated and semi-automated techniques to extract knowledge(info) from large-scale data and use it for future purposes such as prediction, decision making, or recommendation.

Lecture 2
  Data, Machine learning, big data manipulation and processing

  Machine Learning - Designing and constructing algorithms or methods that give computers the ability to learn from past data, without being explicitly programmed, and then make predictions on future data.

  Observation, features, labels, training data, testing data

  Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, semi-supervised learning

Lecture 3
  Classification vs Regression

  KNN

  Scale Features -> Value_Scaled = Value / Max(Value) -> After normalization, 0 <= Value_Scaled <= 1

Lecture 4
  N/A

Lecture 5
  Decision Tree
    Terms: Root, Node, edge, leaf
    3 Things to do in training: 1. Structure of tree (priority features), 2. threshold values, 3. values for leaves.

  Amount of Info has an inverse relationship to the probability of that event
    I(X) = 1/P(X)
    info of 2 events happening = I1(X) + I2(X)
    probability of 2 events happening = I1(X) *I2(X)

Lecture 6
  Entropy - Measures the amount of Uncertainty = 'Expected information'

  Information gain = reduction in Entropy

  Best feature - feature that minimizes entropy

Lecture 7
  N/A

Lecture 8
  N/A

Lecture 9
  Evaluating Accuracy - Split into training and testing data set

Lecture 10
  Linear Regression
